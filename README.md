### Hi there, I'm Janet ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics.

I entered the world of Full Stack Development through a bootcamp program provided by Israel Tech Challenge (ITC) in Tel Aviv, Israel. I continue to learn and enhance my skills by going through code challenges and taking up additional courses in Udemy.

I'm actively looking for a job opportunity. If you'd like to work with me, feel free to reach out through my linkedin account [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janetranada/).
